My name is **Karolis Misiunas** and I created the initial game after getting my first Android phone. It was a fun project that helped me learn to code. Since then the game had contributions from other people and I would like to acknowledge them:

 - **Tautvydas Misiunas** developed the highscore system for v2 and continuously advised on technical aspects. Thanks, bro!
 - **JelleWho** made countless suggestions for the v3. The game looks much better because of you!
