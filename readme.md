# Translations

Want to help? Please help translating the game to your language or correcting spelling for existing translations. Your help is appreciated!

## New translations

For the new translations, download the two template files called [`strings.xml`](https://github.com/kmisiunas/sweeper-craft/raw/master/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) and [`settings.xml`](https://github.com/kmisiunas/sweeper-craft/raw/master/src/main/res/values/settings.xml). The first one is more important than the second one. After translating them to your language, send them over [via email](mailto:support+mcs@misiunas.com). 

## Editing existing translation

All the current translations are available at [this link](https://github.com/kmisiunas/sweeper-craft/tree/master/src/main/res). The folder `values` contains the default English translation, while other languages are indicated by a dash: for example Spanish translation is in `values-es` folder. 

Inside these directories are two files that contain all the text of that language. Most of the important text is in `strings.xml`. Once you changed the strings you want to change, send them over to [me via email](mailto:support+mcs@misiunas.com). Remember to include the 'name="continue_game"' field so I would know what you changed. If your a technical person you can also submit a git pull request.

Thanks for your help!
