# FAQ

 - **Where can I report a bug?**  
   You can report a bug on the [issue tracking page](https://github.com/kmisiunas/minecraft-sweeper/issues) or via [email](mailto:support+mcs@misiunas.com).
 - **Is the project open source?**  
   At the moment only, small parts of the code are available. In the past, people used the code to figure out how to cheat the highscore system. Therefore, I removed the code and also improved the security of the game (this is not a challenge - please don't hack the game). If you would like to contribute some code, please get in touch.
