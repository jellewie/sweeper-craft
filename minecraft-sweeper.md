# MineCraft Sweeper => SweeperCraft

The game used to be called **MineCraft Sweeper**, but in 2016 we renamed it to **SweeperCraft**. This action was forced upon us by Google Play Store and Mojang/Microsoft. They own the rights to the **MineCraft** branding and want to protect it. Fair enough! 

**Disclaimer**: This game is developed independently from Microsoft and Mojang. This game is also not related to [the Minecraft game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en_GB) apart from similar theme.
